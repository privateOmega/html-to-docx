html-to-docx
============

[![NPM Version][npm-image]][npm-url]

html-to-docx is a js library for converting HTML documents to DOCX format supported by Microsoft Word 2007+, LibreOffice Writer, Google Docs, WPS Writer etc.

It was inspired by [html-docx-js] project but mitigates the problem of documents generated being non-compatiable with word processors like Google Docs and libreOffice Writer that doesn't support [altchunks] feature.

html-to-docx earlier used to use [libtidy] to clean up the html before parsing, but had to remove it since it was causing so many dependency issues due to node-gyp.

### Disclaimer

Even though there is an instance of html-to-docx running in production, please ensure that it covers all the cases that you might be encountering usually, since this is not a complete solution.

Currently it doesn't work with browser directly, but it was tested against React.

## Installation

Use the npm to install foobar.

```bash
npm install html-to-docx

```js
await HTMLtoDOCX(htmlString, headerHTMLString, documentOptions, footerHTMLString)

## Notes

Currently page break can be implemented by having div with classname "page-break" or style "page-break-after" despite the values of the "page-break-after", and contents inside the div element will be ignored. `<div class="page-break" style="page-break-after: always;"></div>`
